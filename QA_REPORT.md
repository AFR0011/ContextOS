# ContextOS QA Report

## 2026-06-04 - v0.1.7 Workspace Markdown Canvas

Status: Complete.

Checks run:

- `npm run typecheck` - passed.
- `npm run build` - passed.
- `npx playwright test -g "dashboard canvas|today tasks|offline capture"` - passed, 3 tests.
- `npm run test:e2e` - passed, 16 tests.
- Browser DOM smoke at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` - passed; dashboard editor count was 1 and dark mode class was active.
- Local Playwright screenshot smoke - passed; artifact saved at `test-results/dashboard-dark-smoke.png`.

Notes:

- An initial parallel `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` invocation produced a transient `.next/types` race. Sequential `npm run build` and `npm run typecheck` both passed.
- The in-app browser screenshot API timed out, but DOM smoke passed and a local Playwright screenshot was created and inspected.

Verdict: PASS_WITH_RISKS.
